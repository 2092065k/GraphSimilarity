# Graph Similarity and Clustering

Research into algorithms for measuring graph distance/similarity and clustering of structured data


## The package can be installed by running:

python setup.py install

or through pip:

pip install graphSimilarity


## The expected format for an input file of graphs is as follows:

- a single integer on a line denotes the start of a new graph and signifies
how many nodes are in the graph

- an integer and a float on a line denote the ID of a node and its weight

- three integers on a line denote an edge with its source node, destination node and weight
